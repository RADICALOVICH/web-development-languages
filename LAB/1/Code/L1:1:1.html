        When <em> Naughty Dog </em>revealed <strong>The Last of Us Part 1</strong> earlier this year,
        a complete visual remake of the original <strong>The Last of Us</strong> from <mark>2013</mark>,
        we were a little surprised.
        There's always a debate to be had about the timing of a re-release,
        and we wondered whether the new version would be different enough from the <mark>2014</mark> <em>PS4</em> remaster
        and <mark>2016</mark> <em>PS4 Pro</em> patch to justify a purchase from newcomers to the seasons and series veterans alike.
        After spending some time with the final release,
        we have some answers - including comparisons between the new <em>PS5</em> release and the prior <em>PS3</em> and <em>PS4</em> versions,
        the video modes available and the gameplay changes included.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, let's rewind.
            The Last of Us was the PS3's <strong>swan song</strong>,
            a showpiece title released just months before the arrival of the <em>PS4</em>. 
            The mix of storytelling, survival horror and action resonated with fans,
            becoming one of <em>Naughty Dog's</em> most successful games ever.
            The technical challenge <em>Naughty Dog's</em> created for itself was the creation of a world
            almost entirely devoid of electric lights(<small>The Last of Us relies heavily on indirect lighting which,
            in <mark>2013</mark>, was still very difficult to achieve even when leaning on pre-calculated techniques).</small>
            Against the odds,
            Naughty Dog did manage to come up with a suitable solution to this problem - it's far from perfect,
            mind you, but the world was convincingly lit and designed.
            The problem was that on <em>PS3</em>, the performance just didn't hold up and many larger areas exhibited severe frame-rate issues that detracted from the experience.
