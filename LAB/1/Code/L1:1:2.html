        When <b> Naughty Dog </b>revealed <strong>The Last of Us Part 1</strong> earlier this year,
        a complete visual remake of the original <strong>The Last of Us</strong> from <mark>2013</mark>,
        we were a little surprised.
        There's always a debate to be had about the timing of a re-release,
        and we wondered whether the new version would be different enough from the <mark>2014</mark> <b>PS4</b> remaster
        and <mark>2016</mark> <b>PS4 Pro</b> patch to justify a purchase from newcomers to the seasons and series veterans alike.
        After spending some time with the final release,
        we have some answers - including comparisons between the new <b>PS5</b> release and the prior <b>PS3</b> and <b>PS4</b> versions,
        the video modes available and the gameplay changes included.
        </p>
        <p>
            First, let's rewind.
            The Last of Us was the PS3's <strong>swan song</strong>,
            a showpiece title released just months before the arrival of the <b>PS4</b>. 
            The mix of storytelling, survival horror and action resonated with fans,
            becoming one of <b>Naughty Dog's</b> most successful games ever.
            The technical challenge <b>Naughty Dog's</b> created for itself was the creation of a world
            almost entirely devoid of electric lights(<small>The Last of Us relies heavily on indirect lighting which,
            in <mark>2013</mark>, was still very difficult to achieve even when leaning on pre-calculated techniques).</small>
            Against the odds,
            Naughty Dog did manage to come up with a suitable solution to this problem - it's far from perfect,
            mind you, but the world was convincingly lit and designed.
            The problem was that on <b>PS3</b>, the performance just didn't hold up and many larger areas exhibited severe frame-rate issues that detracted from the experience.
