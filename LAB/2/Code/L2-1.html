            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <span class="name"> Naughty Dog </span>revealed <span class="TLOU">The Last of Us Part 1</span> earlier this year,
            a complete visual remake of the original <span class="TLOU">The Last of Us</span> from <span class="date">2013</span>,
            we were a little surprised.
            There's always a debate to be had about the timing of a re-release,
            and we wondered whether the new version would be different enough from the <span class="date">2014</span> <span class="name">PS4</span> remaster
            and <span class="date">2016</span> <span class="name">PS4 Pro</span> patch to justify a purchase from newcomers to the seasons and series veterans alike.
            After spending some time with the final release,
            we have some answers - including comparisons between the new <span class="name">PS5</span> release and the prior <span class="name">PS3</span> and <span class="name">PS4</span> versions,
            the video modes available and the gameplay changes included.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let's rewind.
                The Last of Us was the PS3's <span class="TLOU">swan song</span>,
                a showpiece title released just months before the arrival of the <span class="name">PS4</span>. 
                The mix of storytelling, survival horror and action resonated with fans,
                becoming one of <span class="name">Naughty Dog's</span> most successful games ever.
                The technical challenge <span class="name">Naughty Dog's</span> created for itself was the creation of a world
                almost entirely devoid of electric lights(<small>The Last of Us relies heavily on indirect lighting which,
                in <span class="date">2013</span>, was still very difficult to achieve even when leaning on pre-calculated techniques).</small>
                Against the odds,
                Naughty Dog did manage to come up with a suitable solution to this problem - it's far from perfect,
                mind you, but the world was convincingly lit and designed.
                The problem was that on <span class="name">PS3</span>, the performance just didn't hold up and many larger areas exhibited severe frame-rate issues that detracted from the experience.
